# Mermaid.js vs OpenFlowKit

Mermaid.js is an incredible text-based diagramming tool that has become the standard for markdown-based documentation. However, when you need a presentation-ready, highly interactive canvas, raw Mermaid can sometimes feel limiting.

This is why **OpenFlowKit is built on top of Mermaid.js**, giving you the best of both worlds: Diagram-as-code speed with visual-editor polish.

## 1. Aesthetics and Branding

**Mermaid.js:**
- Renders SVGs based on predefined themes (default, dark, forest, neutral).
- Customizing styles requires inline CSS classes, which can clutter your markdown.

**OpenFlowKit:**
- Features a full **White-Label Design System**.
- You can inject [Theming](/docs/en/theming) tokens dynamically (colors, corner radii, fonts).
- Nodes automatically adopt glassmorphism, shadows, and modern UI treatments without writing a single line of CSS.

## 2. Interaction and Editing

**Mermaid.js:**
- Strictly code-in, diagram-out. To move a node, you rewrite the code.
- Layouts are handled automatically by Dagre, which is great but offers zero manual control if a line routes awkwardly.

**OpenFlowKit:**
- **Two-Way Sync**: Write code and watch the canvas update, *or* drag a node on the canvas and watch the code update automatically. 
- You get full drag-and-drop capabilities, manual edge routing, and [Smart Layouts](/docs/en/smart-layout) via ELK.js.

## 3. Export Options

**Mermaid.js:**
- Typically exports as SVG or PNG via a CLI or browser extension.

**OpenFlowKit:**
- Native [Exporting](/docs/en/exporting) to SVG, high-res PNG/JPG.
- **Figma Editable**: OpenFlowKit can export diagrams directly to your clipboard in a format that pastes into Figma as native, editable vector layers and text objects.

## 4. Artificial Intelligence

While AI can write Mermaid syntax, iterating on it is difficult.

**OpenFlowKit:**
- Integrated [Flowpilot AI](/docs/en/ask-flowpilot) directly into the [Command Center](/docs/en/command-center).
- You can prompt the AI, generate the canvas, and then manually adjust the final 10% visually instead of trying to perfectly craft a prompt to fix a misaligned node.
- Supports **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** for 7 different AI providers.

## Direct Compatibility

We love Mermaid. That is why OpenFlowKit has a native [Mermaid Integration](/docs/en/mermaid-integration). You can paste any existing Mermaid flowchart or state diagram into OpenFlowKit, and it will instantly convert it into editable, styled React Flow nodes.
